\begin{myblock}{{\large Introduction}}
	

\textbf{Motivation:}\\
 the Search and Rescue Robots Market is projected to grow with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of more than 20\%\footnote{\url{https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/search-and-rescue-robots-market}}.
 Allied Market Research, reported that the global inspection,  and surveillance robots market generated \$940 million in 2020 and is expected to reach close to \$14 billion by 2030\footnote{\url{https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/26/robotic-dogs-taking-on-jobs-in-security-inspection-and-public-safety-.html}}.	\\
	
	
\textbf{Problem:}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemindent}{-10pt}
	\item lack of textit{generic} and \textit{robot agnostic} control software solutions to control quadruped robots
	\item  absence of a common and standardized software framework, high level of expertise required to control such platforms,
	\item   increased Complexity  when the quadruped robots are equipped with one (or more) manipulator(s)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{20pt}
	
\textbf{Solution:} Wolf

\end{figure}

\vspace{20pt}
\textbf{In more details:}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemindent}{-10pt}
	\item   end-to-end software suite devoted to the loco-manipulation of quadruped robots. 
	\item abstracts the complexity of planning and control of quadrupedal robot hardware 
	\item allows multiple tele-operation devices
	\end{itemize}

The diagram is composed of four logical layers: the user and navigation input layer, the walking pattern generator, the whole-body inverse dynamics, and the reactive layer. Each layer is composed of one or more components. A description of the layers and their components is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:components}.\textcolor{red}{simplify this or put full page} }
	\label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Features:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item plug-and-play software framework, easy to tune 
	\item  adaptable to any quadruped robot without the need for specific knowledge about locomotion or control.	
	\item promote strandardization: use of established robotics tools and technologies such as ROS~\cite{quigley2009ros}, Gazebo~\cite{agueroVRC2015}, OpenSoT~\cite{hoffmanOpenSoT2017} 	
	\item  Differently from CHAMP, WoLF features support for on-board manipulators.
	\item extend the capabilities of quadrupedal platforms with manipulation and navigation skills.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How is it done?}\\
\vspace{20pt}
The WoLF project started from the work in~\cite{raiola2020} about a novel locomotion framework for quadrupedal robots. 
We designed it to work as a plugin for ros\_control \cite{chitta2017ros_control}. The ros\_control package permits to easily abstract the particular hardware for both the quadruped and/or the manipulator and therefore to re-use the same controller with different robots provided that they expose an effort interface.
